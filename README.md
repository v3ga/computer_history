## Computer pionneers

### Ada Lovelace
* [France Culture / Ada Lovelace, la grande ordinatrice](https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/la-methode-scientifique/ada-lovelace-la-grande-ordinatrice)<br />*Quelle a √©t√© la vie de la comtesse anglaise Ada Lovelace ? Quels ont √©t√© ses recherches et travaux qui ont fait d‚Äôelle la premi√®re personne de l‚ÄôHistoire √† avoir cr√©√© un programme informatique ? A quelle machine s‚Äôint√©ressait-elle, √† quels probl√®mes math√©matiques ?*
* [Stephen Wolfram ‚Äî Untangling the tale of Ada Lovelace](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace/)
<br />*To some she is a great hero in the history of computing; to others an overestimated minor figure. I‚Äôve been curious for a long time what the real story is. And in preparation for her bicentennial, I decided to try to solve what for me has always been the ‚Äúmystery of Ada‚Äù.*
* [Two-Bit History ‚Äî¬†What Did Ada Lovelace's Program Actually Do?](https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/18/ada-lovelace-note-g.html)
<br />*In fairness, Lovelace‚Äôs program is not easy to explain to the layperson without some hand-waving. It‚Äôs the intricacies of her program, though, that make it so remarkable. Whether or not she ought to be known as ‚Äúthe first programmer,‚Äù her program was specified with a degree of rigor that far surpassed anything that came before.*

### Alan Turing
* [France Culture / Grande travers√©e : l'√©nigmatique Alan Turing](https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/lenigmatique-alan-turing)

Car c‚Äôest bien une machine abstraite qu‚ÄôAlan Turing a invent√©e pour expliquer la notion de ¬´ proc√©dure m√©canique ¬ª : on parle d‚Äôalgorithme. Cette machine est la plus √©l√©mentaire possible destin√©e √† mettre en ≈ìuvre ces m√©canismes de calcul, num√©riques ou symboliques, comme le font notamment les ordinateurs.*
